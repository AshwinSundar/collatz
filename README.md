# Collatz Conjecture

The [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is an unsolved problem in mathematics, caters to follows the following formula:

* If a number is even, divide it by 2.
* If a number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.

The conjecture states that all integers will converge to 1, but this is currently unproven. Thwaites has offered a Â£1000 reward for a proof resolving the conjecture.
